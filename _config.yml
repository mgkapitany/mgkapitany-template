  Hello World!Hello! 👋 I’m Margaret, recent BBA graduate who is passionate about technology, business model innovation, and data. As a gamer at heart, I’m driven by curiosity and the excitement of finding solutions. I thrive in challenging situations and accomplish my best with dynamic & motivated individuals. I’m always learning and adapting from my failures.

  My work experience spans various functions: business development, agile product development, and consulting in both client and internal facing roles. I love to embrace the complexities of data sets to find opportunities for process improvement, and I've gained a deep passion for delivering value through effective agile project management. Above all, I am loyal to user-focused innovation. I’m eager to embrace new opportunities in analytics, product development, and business process analysis – if anything on my profile interest you and you’d like to chat more, let’s connect!
