  Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Margaret, recent BBA graduate who is passionate about technology, business model innovation, and data. As a gamer at heart, Iâ€™m driven by curiosity and the excitement of finding solutions. Iâ€™m always learning and adapting from my failures.
  <br><br>
  My work experience spans various functions: business development, agile product development, and consulting in both client and internal facing roles. I love to embrace the complexities of data sets to find opportunities for process improvement. Iâ€™m eager to embrace new opportunities in analytics, product development, and business process analysis â€“ if anything on my profile interest you and youâ€™d like to chat more, letâ€™s connect!
